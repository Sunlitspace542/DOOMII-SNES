Here's a really simple SRAM memory map.

The important things from a game perspective are the patch entry point,
the game comms session record and the game results record

Top of SRAM:			$E10000

OS Private stuff in here (dbase, etc)

Beginning of os space:		$E0255c

Gametime os stuff lives here

Game results record:		$E0245c	; *** all results stuff goes in here
Game comms session:		$E02300	; *** pass this into gametalk functions for the session ptr

End of game patch space:	$E02000

The game patch and it's data live in here

GamePatchEntryPoint:		$E00210	; *** the main entry point for the game patch

OSLow Memory globals live here

Bottom of SRAM:			$E00000
