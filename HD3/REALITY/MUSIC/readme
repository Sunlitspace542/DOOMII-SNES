****************** EXPLANATIONS FOR MULTIPLE BLAST BUFFER BUILDS
****** RANDY's Variables

BlastBufferCnt                  - How many blast buffers allocated by musician
BlastBufferSize                 - how large in bytes each blast buffer is
BlastBufferAddress              - absolute start address of first blast buffer
TotalBlastBufferSize            - how much memory is allocated total for blast


(EFFECTNAME)_eff_BWV            - bwave number for the effect


SPECIAL NOTES TO RANDY

    You may basically allocate memory freely as you wish using
    BlastBufferAddress  and TotalBlastBufferSize above for general direction.

    There is a new DCOM command called DCOM_SETWAVEASBLAST which will allow
    you to set a blast buffer to an effect waveform. This simplifies your
    allocation greatly. This command sets up correct addressing and loop offsets
    for the blasted effect based on your setting of the blast address when this
    command is set. It adjusts start and loop offsets for the waveform so you
    only need keep track of memory allocation.
    It is documented in DCOM.I. Also, DO NOT USE
    DCOM_BLASTEFFECT (DCOM command 24) if you are using multiple buffers. It is
    only used to shutdown the previous blast sound and to keep track of the next
    blast sound to shut down. It will only cause problems in your allocation and
    is not necessary other than internal single blast allocation.

    Please let me know if you need anything more or if this does not work as
    expected. (Hopefully no problems, seems to work fine here).
